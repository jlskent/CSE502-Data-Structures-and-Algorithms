Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question PS1:
A
-For the linear, the graph shows (dots to form)a straight line for the ticks, and (dots to form) a several little horizontal lines going up for the time(which eventually looks a single straignt line)
-For the quadratic, it shows (dots to form) a curve(of quadratic function) for the ticks and (dots to form) a less smooth curve for the time
B
-Yes.As n grows, ticks and time for linear and quadratic grow in different speed. 
C
-The ticker is executed n times in linear, but it is executed n*n times in the quadratic.

Question PS2:
-The time spent in linear is too little and may not be accurate, compared with quadratic.

Question PS3: 
-place the ticker outside the loop: ticks becomes constant(horizontal line), and time is still the same(this.value...still excutes)
-place the ticker inside the outer loop: ticks becomes a straignt line (linear function) and time is still the same(like above)
so it influence ticks only, since the other operation still executes

Question PS4: 
-it generates a curve of quadratic function(for time and ticks)
-if we place ticker outside of loop, it generates a horizontal line
-if we place ticker inside outer loop, it generates a line going up
		
Question PS5: 
-time is still quadratic funciton of n
-tick is a linear function of n
